When a user arrives at the homepage the user will be prompted to input a sentence.
The user will also be prompted to put in a single word in order to check if that word is in the sentence that was inputted.
The user will then be prompted to click the submit button.
The submit button will take them to a results page.
The results page will display to the user their sentence, their single word, and a number that represents the amount of times that their word was in their sentence.
The results page will also have a button to take the user back to the homepage and restart the experience.

Example:
user input 1 = the cat walked the elephant
user input 2 = elephant

Example 2:
user input 1 = the cat walked the elephant and the other cat
user input 2 = cat
result = your word matched a word in your sentence: 2 times
